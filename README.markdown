# KeyboardTools

This implements user-space drivers for the Logitech G15 gaming
keyboard on MacOS X.

They were originally written for pre-10.5 MacOS and are currently
being upgraded for 10.7. Not all functionality is present yet.

# Thanks and Acknowledgements

The g15tools project for Linux provided the starting point for this
MacOS version. While no code has been used due to the different APIs
their reverse engineering work was very helpful
